# Hey, I'm Nate 👋

Full stack engineer currently building a multi-tenant B2B SaaS platform from the ground up—database design, REST APIs, React web app, and React Native mobile.

## What I'm working on

At **The Energy Network**, I helped build a multi-tenant B2B SaaS platform from the ground up. No existing codebase—we designed the data model, built the API layer, and shipped both web and mobile clients. The platform (Raterflow) handles energy efficiency inspections and replaced two failing legacy systems.

I own requirements gathering, stakeholder communication, and product demos while partnering with a senior engineer on architecture decisions.

## Background

Before writing code professionally, I spent 5 years at **Alarm.com** doing technical troubleshooting and working directly with engineering teams—diagnosing complex issues, creating detailed bug reports, and bridging communication between support and development. That's where I built the debugging instincts and cross-functional communication skills I use every day.

## Tech I work with

**Core:** TypeScript, React, Next.js, PostgreSQL, Drizzle ORM, Zod  
**APIs & Infrastructure:** Hono, Cloudflare Workers, Supabase, Cloudflare R2, Vercel  
**Frontend:** TanStack Query, TanStack Form, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui  
**Mobile:** React Native, Expo  
**Tooling:** Turborepo, Vitest, Biome, GitHub Actions, Sentry  
**Familiar:** Python, AWS, Git
